  I've always felt the need to share the things I find interesting, and to do so at scale. My attempts so far have not been very focused. Eventually, the need to share outgrew the procrastination of getting started is all that I can say.

  This site is a blog, portfolio, gallery, review forum, update board and more. The current framework is based on what excites me the most.

  I didn't find themes to build on that I liked and was too lazy/had no time to build one from scratch (well I might in the future for the learning). Until I came across [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) by [Xin](https://imfing.com/). Hosted on GitHub Pages, pointing to my custom domain, it was a painless setup process. Now I can focus on writing than complaining.
