I've been putting off the thought building a landing page of sorts for myself for quite some time.

Although this isn't much to show for the time spent, I thought I might as well put myself out there for social accountability.

{{% details title="Why" closed="true" %}}
I've always felt the need to share things I find interesting and to do so at scale. My attempts have not been very focused. Eventually the need to share outgrew the procrastination of getting is all that I can say.

{{% details title="What" closed="true" %}}
This can be a blog, portfolio, gallery, review forum, update board and more. As of now I am just building as is and will refine as I go. Currently, I am creating a framework on the basis of what excites me the most.

{{% details title="How" closed="true" %}}
I didn't find themes to build on that I liked and was too lazy/had no time to build one from scratch (well I might in the future for the learning). Until I came across [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) by [Xin](https://imfing.com/). Hosted on GitHub Pages, pointing to my custom domain, it was a painless setup process. Now I can focus on writing than complaining.

Feedback would be invaluable at this stage. Let me know how I can make this better and help you in any way I can.
