{{% details title="Why" closed="true" %}}
I've always felt the need to share the things I find interesting, and to do so at scale. My attempts so far have not been very focused. Eventually, the need to share outgrew the procrastination of getting started is all that I can say.

{{% details title="What" closed="true" %}}
This site is a blog, portfolio, gallery, review forum, update board and more. The current framework is based on what excites me the most.

{{% details title="How" closed="true" %}}
I didn't find themes to build on that I liked and was too lazy/had no time to build one from scratch (well I might in the future for the learning). Until I came across [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) by [Xin](https://imfing.com/). Hosted on GitHub Pages, pointing to my custom domain, it was a painless setup process. Now I can focus on writing than complaining.

I've been putting off the thought building a landing page of sorts for myself for quite some time. Although this isn't much to show for the time spent, I thought I might as well put myself out there for social accountability.

Feedback would be invaluable at this stage. Let me know how I can make this better and help you in any way I can.
